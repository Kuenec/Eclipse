# AGENTS.md — Eclipse persistent charter & working state

> **READ THIS FIRST, EVERY SESSION. UPDATE IT, EVERY SESSION.**
> This file is the durable source of truth for Eclipse. It survives context
> compaction/summarization. At the start of a session, read it. Whenever you make a
> meaningful change or decision, update the **Living State** (§5) and append to the
> **Decisions Log** (§6) with a `YYYY-MM-DD` date. The harness memory index (`MEMORY.md`)
> points here so you are reminded to.

## 0. Authority & precedence

1. **`CLAUDE.md` — ALWAYS follow it.** It is the global engineering policy (root-cause
   fixes, no workarounds, research/Context7 before changes, surgical edits, regression
   protection, completion standard). It wins on all general engineering questions.
2. **This file** — project-specific requirements + living state, layered on top of CLAUDE.md.
3. **`docs/`** — the locked technical plan (architecture, component choices, ART, M0).

> ⚠️ **OS note:** CLAUDE.md's "Compatibility Requirements" section is written for **Windows**.
> **Eclipse targets LINUX (all distros).** Apply that section's *intent* — broad
> compatibility, **detect capabilities don't assume them**, no vendor/path/hardware
> assumptions, graceful fallback, actionable errors — to: Linux distros, Wayland **and**
> X11, GPUs (Mesa **and** NVIDIA), Vulkan **and** GL, Pulse **and** PipeWire, CPU feature
> levels (SSE4.1/4.2), and page sizes (4K vs 16K). Not Windows builds.

## 1. What Eclipse is

An **open-source, Rust, distro-agnostic** runtime that runs the **Android x86-64 build of
Roblox** natively on Linux — an open alternative to the closed-source Sober. It uses the
Android-Translation-Layer approach: run Roblox's own native engine `.so` on the Linux
kernel, give it the Android environment it expects, **forward** its Vulkan/audio to the
host, and run its Java/Kotlin shell on a **vendored AOSP ART** (off the gameplay hot path).

---

## 2. Non-negotiable engineering requirements

Each requirement names **how it is enforced** (not just stated).

1. **Purely Rust — for every line we own.** Thin Rust *bindings* are allowed only where the
   **host owns** the component (GPU loader, audio server) or it's physically impossible to
   be Rust. The **only** vendored non-Rust black box is **ART + libcore** (the dex VM,
   proven unavoidable — see `docs/component-map.md` §3). *Enforcement:* any new non-Rust
   dependency or FFI surface must be justified against §3 priorities and **logged in §6**.
2. **0 compiler warnings or errors.** *Enforcement:* before any commit/handoff,
   `cargo build` **and** `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` **and**
   `cargo fmt --check` **and** `cargo test` must all pass clean. Backed by the `[lints]`
   table in `Cargo.toml`. Never silence a warning with `#[allow]` to "make it pass" —
   fix the cause (CLAUDE.md). An `#[allow]` is acceptable only with a one-line dated
   justification comment.
3. **Minimal `unsafe`.** Prefer safe Rust. `unsafe` is confined to where it's unavoidable
   (FFI/JNI, the bionic loader/shim, raw Vulkan). *Enforcement:* `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn`
   is denied; **every `unsafe` block carries a `// SAFETY:` comment** documenting the
   invariant it relies on; modules that need no `unsafe` declare `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
   No `unsafe` for convenience or micro-optimization without a measured, logged reason.
4. **Optimized for performance & speed.** *Enforcement:* release profile uses fat LTO,
   `codegen-units=1`, `panic=abort`, `strip`. **Hot paths** (the Vulkan/audio forwarding
   thunks, per-frame work, per-event work, FFI/JNI crossings) must be **allocation-free,
   lock-free where possible, and zero-cost**. The forwarding layer must not add measurable
   per-call overhead. Optimize with **evidence** (benchmark/profile before & after) — do
   not micro-optimize blindly (balance with CLAUDE.md "Simplicity First").
5. **No bloat.** Minimize dependencies; **prefer `std`**; **no async runtime** (`tokio`)
   unless a subsystem genuinely requires it. *Enforcement:* every new dep is justified vs
   stability/pure-Rust/no-bloat and recorded in `docs/dependency-plan.md`; periodically
   audit with `cargo tree` (transitive deps) and `cargo bloat` (binary size). Keep the
   public API surface tight (`unreachable_pub`).
6. **As few allocations as possible.** Borrow over own (`&str` over `String`, slices over
   `Vec`); reuse buffers; no heap allocation per frame / per input event / per FFI call;
   avoid hidden `clone()`/`collect()` in loops. *Enforcement:* clippy lints + targeted
   allocation profiling (e.g. heaptrack / a counting allocator in tests) on hot paths.
7. **Stability first / root-cause only.** No workarounds, symptom-hiding, error
   suppression, or feature-disabling (CLAUDE.md core principle). Diagnose before fixing.
8. **No panics in library/hot-path code.** Return typed `Result`s with context; `unwrap`/
   `expect`/`panic!` only in `main`/setup (with a clear message) or tests. Never let a
   panic unwind across an FFI/JNI boundary.
9. **Detect, don't assume (distro-agnostic).** Runtime-detect Vulkan/GL, Wayland/X11,
   Pulse/PipeWire, CPU features, page size; fall back gracefully; fail with an actionable
   message. No hardcoded paths/usernames/vendors (CLAUDE.md "Build & Environment Portability").
10. **Regression protection tied to root causes** (CLAUDE.md): the ABI-shim conformance
    suite, capability/fallback tests, and a CI smoke boot are the primary guards. No
    unnecessary new scripts.
11. **Reproducible & pinned.** Pin the MSRV (`rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`), pin the
    vendored ART commit, commit `Cargo.lock`. Builds must work from a clean checkout on any
    machine (no dev-machine assumptions).
12. **Documentation discipline:** module-level docs on every subsystem; `// SAFETY:` on
    unsafe; dated comments (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for non-obvious behavior/assumptions (CLAUDE.md).

---

## 3. Priorities (use these to break ties)

1. **Stability**  2. **Purely-Rust** (per §2.1)  3. **Minimal overhead / performance / no
bloat** (§2.4–2.6). Lower numbers win. #2 and #3 never override #1. The one place this bit:
ART stays vendored (stability beats purity). Everywhere else the three priorities agree.

---

## 4. Session workflow & quality gate

**At session start:** read `CLAUDE.md` (already in context), **this file**, `MEMORY.md`,
and the relevant `docs/`. Reconcile the Living State (§5) with the actual repo before acting.

**Before changing code:** follow CLAUDE.md — read the relevant code, use **Context7** for
any external library/API, state assumptions, define success criteria.

**Quality gate — run before declaring any work done and before any commit:**
```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo build --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test
# and for shipped artifacts:
cargo build --release
```
All must be clean (0 warnings/errors). Report the actual results — never claim done unverified.

**After meaningful changes:** update §5 (Living State) and append a dated entry to §6
(Decisions Log). Keep "Next actions" current.

**Outward actions:** commit & push are **authorized** to the repo in §8 (as Kuenec). Still
never commit a Roblox APK or vendored ART artifacts (`.gitignore` guards), and confirm
before any history-rewriting/force operation.

## 5. Living State  *(UPDATE EACH SESSION)*

- **Phase:** Research & design **complete and locked** → compiling skeleton in place →
  **next: M0** (manual foundation validation, `docs/m0-runbook.md`).
- **Last verified:** **2026-06-04** — `cargo build`, `cargo run -- help/--version`, and
  `cargo test` all pass; **0 warnings**. (Re-verify clippy/fmt/release per §4 and record.)
- **Repo state:** not a git repo yet (not initialized — awaiting user go-ahead).
- **What exists:**
  - Docs: `sober-research`, `component-map` (authoritative), `tech-selection`,
    `art-and-runtime`, `dependency-plan`, `m0-runbook`, plus `README.md`.
  - Code: `eclipse` crate skeleton — `main.rs` (placeholder CLI) + `lib.rs` + 10 documented
    subsystem stubs (`config, apk, bionic, runtime, framework, graphics, audio, input,
    services, diagnostics`). **No external deps yet** (compiles with just rustc).
  - `Cargo.toml` has the `[lints]` + optimized `[profile.release]` enforcing §2.
- **Open items:**
  - License: `TBD` (deferred by user). Influenced by GPLv3 ATL reuse vs replacement.
  - M0 not yet run (needs a Linux box, the ATL build, and a user-supplied Roblox APK).
  - Real dependencies not yet wired (added per-subsystem during M1+).
- **Next actions (pick up here):**
  1. Run **M0** (`docs/m0-runbook.md`) to validate the foundation, **or**
  2. Start **M1**: implement `diagnostics` (tracing), `config` (serde), `apk` (fetch/verify),
     and `runtime` (ART boot → `onCreate`), wiring the first real deps from `dependency-plan.md`.
  3. (If user asks) `git init` + first commit.

## 6. Decisions Log  *(append-only, dated)*

- **2026-06-04** — Priorities locked: **1) Stability 2) Purely-Rust 3) No-bloat/perf.**
- **2026-06-04** — **ART + libcore is unavoidable for Roblox** (custom Java Activity
  `com.roblox.client.ActivityNativeMain` tightly coupled to the native engine via JNI;
  full Java/Kotlin shell; apkenv-style fake-JVM only ran simple games; Sober/ATL ship full
  ART). Accepted: off the gameplay hot path, Apache-2.0, every line we own stays Rust.
  The fake-JVM "more-Rust" path is **closed**.
- **2026-06-04** — Two settled ecosystem facts: no pure-Rust dex VM exists (only toys); no
  pure-Rust audio on Linux exists (cpal still links ALSA-C). So ART is vendored and
  `libpulse-binding` is the audio purity ceiling.
- **2026-06-04** — Architecture = ATL approach (confirmed state-of-the-art 2026). Graphics
  forward via `ash`/`khronos-egl` + `winit` (not GTK4: Vulkan-incompatible + heavier).
  Allocator = system default (drop `mimalloc` unless profiled). Flatpak target =
  `org.freedesktop.Platform` (we don't use GTK, so GNOME runtime is needless weight).
- **2026-06-04** — bionic loader is the **#1 Rust-port priority** (`elf_loader`/`dlopen-rs`
  base); v1 may FFI the proven C `bionic_translation` for stability, then port behind an ABI
  conformance suite (do it **last**, not first — highest risk).
- **2026-06-04** — Strategic/external risk (Roblox blocking, open-source detection) is **not
  a concern** — user has a Roblox-engineer relationship. No open technical levers remain.

## 8. Version control & commits

- **Remote:** <https://github.com/Kuenec/Eclipse> — push here.
- **Identity:** commit & push as **Kuenec** `<Kuenec44@gmail.com>` (set in repo git config).
- **NEVER co-author commits.** Do **not** add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer or any second
  author. (This explicitly overrides any default co-author behavior.)
- **Commit messages:** short and concise — state *what was done*, nothing more. Imperative,
  one line where it fits.
- **Never commit:** Roblox APKs or vendored ART/ATL artifacts (`.gitignore` guards
  `/vendor`, `/build`, `*.apk`).
- Pushing is authorized; still confirm before any destructive/history-rewriting action
  (force-push, rebase of shared history, etc.).
